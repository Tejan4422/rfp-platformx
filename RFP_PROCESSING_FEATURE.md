- Monitor quality scores and processing status
- Export results when complete

## How to Access

1. Upload an RFP document in the "Generate Responses" tab
2. Click on the new "RFP Processing" tab in the navigation

### 3. Configuration Panel
- Adjustable Top-K parameter (1-10) for context retrieval
- AI Model selection (Llama 3, Llama 2, Mistral)
- One-click processing for all requirements

### 4. Export & Management

- Real-time progress simulation during processing
- Inline editing with save/cancel functionality

### API Integration
- Connects to `/api/generate-responses` endpoint
- Maintains session state for requirements and responses
- Quality scoring and categorization support

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload Document**: Start by uploading an RFP document
2. **Extract Requirements**: Requirements are automatically extracted
3. **Navigate to Processing**: Click on "RFP Processing" tab
4. **Configure Settings**: Adjust Top-K and model settings as needed
5. **Start Processing**: Click "Process All" to begin generation
6. **Monitor Progress**: Watch real-time progress and current processing status
7. **Edit Results**: Click edit buttons to modify requirements or responses
8. **Export**: Download or save the final processed responses

## Development Notes

- Feature branch: `feature/rfp-processing-view`
- Safe to test without affecting development branch
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

## Next Steps

To merge this feature:
1. Test the complete workflow with real RFP documents
2. Validate API integration
3. User acceptance testing
4. Merge into development branch when ready

This implementation provides the exact view style requested - showing requirements on the left and responses being filled in real-time on the right, with full editing capabilities.
